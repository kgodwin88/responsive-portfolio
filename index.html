                <p> 
                    My name is Kevin and I was born in Wilson, North Carolina and have lived in North Carolina my entire life.  I originally went to school to for Electronic Engineering but after
                    getting my Associates degree I decided to go to school for automotive.  After I graduated with my degree in automotive I got a job working at Audi in Raleigh, North Carolina
                    and moved to Raleigh. While I was living in Raleigh I married my beautiful wife Alicia and not long after we were married we decided to move to the Charlotte area were I started to 
                    work for Audi of Charlotte. Not long after we moved to Charlotte we had our first son. 
                </p>
                    <br/>
                    
                <p>
                    Now that I have been working on cars for 6 years it is starting to get old and has put a toll on my body causing me to be in pain all the time.  So I have decided to pursue a new
                    career in web development and that is why I started the UNC Bootcamp program in hopes of jumpstarting my career without having to get a 4 year degree.
